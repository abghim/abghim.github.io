title: Custom MicroGNUEmacs Fork
excerpt_separator: "<!--more-->"
---
MicroGNUEmacs (or mg) has recently replaced Emacs as my primary code editor. The actively maintained editor is a haven for editor minimalists. <!--more-->No syntax highlighting, no extension framework, no lisp, but most of GNU Emacs within 264KB.

What I found slightly disturbing was its C-mode for KNF-compliant editing. The default bracket blink could be disabled easily, but the colon-snap-to-label for C labels (case: ) was not good. Tab width of 4 also did not cooperate smoothly. 

So I forked the repo with minor edits. It's now on <a href="https://github.com/abghim/mg">abghim/mg</a> with my own personal mods, along with better build instructions and suggested .mg startup file.

Contrary to what most would imagine, mg editing is delightfully fast and efficient. This is just an attempt to make it slightly more so.
