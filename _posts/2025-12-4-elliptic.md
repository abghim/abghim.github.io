The area of an ellipse is given by $\pi a b$, where a and b are half-width and half-height -- straightforward enough. But what about the arc length of an ellipse? Faced with a problem infinitely more complex than that of a circle, here our problems begin. <!--more-->

Quick intuition regarding arc length of parameterized curves easily lead us to an integral of the form $s=\int^{2\pi}_0 \sqrt{1-e^2 \cos ^2 t }dt$.
