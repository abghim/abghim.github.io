title: A Bird's-Eye-View of the Lebesgue Integral
excerpt-separator: <!--more-->

As an AP Calculus student too often dissatisfied by the lack of proofs in the course, I often venture into other fields of higher math. The hand-wavy definition of limits led me to the epsilon-delta argument. Intermediate value theorem led me to the completeness axiom on $\mathbb{R}$. Extreme value theorem gave rise to compactness and the Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem.<!--more-->

I discovered the world of measure theory and the Lebesgue (pronounced la-BEG) integral, when I was told that some functions cannot be integrated with Riemann sums. A more general integral, which has Riemann integrals as its subset, goes down an incredibly deep rabbit hole in the study of the reals.

First things first, integration is defined by either area under a curve or the inverse process of differentiation. For now, let us just consider the former, in the notion of the definite integral.

The idea of Riemann sums is to chop up the area under a curve into infinitely many intervals, with respect to the x-axis, then finding the sum. The idea of infinitely many chops is formalized by taking the limit.

In mathematical formalization, the Riemann sum is defined by $$\int^b_a f(t)dt = \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{b-a}{n} \sum^{n}_{i=1} f(a+(b-a)/n*i)$$ in a way that precisely shows its conceptual definition. There are numerous other formulations, all of which converge to the same sum. Or they don't.

Some functions show a mismatch between two different versions of the Riemann sum. In the same way a limit is undefined if the left-handed and the right-handed limit is distinct, the Riemann integral of some functions will simply be undefined. Take, for example, a function $f(x)$ that returns 0 if x is irrational and 1 if x is rational, where x is between 0 and 1 (either inclusive or strictly). For any partitioned subintervals of $x$, there are always both 1's and 0's to choose the height from. The Lebesgue integral resolves the problem and integrates a wider range of functions (but still not all functions $\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$).

## Lebesgue Measure
Lebesgue integrals are defined using Lebesgue measure, written as $\mu (A)$ where A is a subset of $\mathbb{R}$.
