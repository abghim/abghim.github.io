title: A Bird's-Eye-View of the Lebesgue Integral
---
I discovered the world of measure theory and the Lebesgue (pronounced la-BEG) integral, when I was told that some functions cannot be integrated with Riemann sums. A more general integral, which has Riemann integrals as its subset, goes down an incredibly deep rabbit hole in the study of the reals.<!--more-->

First things first, integration is defined by either area under a curve or the inverse process of differentiation. For now, let us just consider the former, in the notion of the definite integral.

The idea of Riemann sums is to chop up the area under a curve into infinitely many intervals, with respect to the x-axis, then finding the sum. The idea of infinitely many chops is formalized by taking the limit.

In mathematical formalization, the Riemann sum is defined by \\[\int^b_a f(t)dt = \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{b-a}{n} \sum^{n}_{i=1} f(a+\frac{b-a}{n} i)\\] in a way that precisely shows its conceptual definition. There are numerous other formulations, all of which converge to the same sum. Except when they don't.

Some functions show a mismatch between two different versions of the Riemann sum. In the same way a limit is undefined if the left-handed and the right-handed limit is distinct, the Riemann integral of some functions will simply be undefined. The Lebesgue integral resolves the problem and integrates a wider range of functions (but still not all functions $\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$). That said, all Riemaan integrable functions are also Lebesgue integrable, and the two integrals will have the same value.

## Lebesgue Measure
Lebesgue integrals are defined using Lebesgue measure, written as $\mu (A)$ where A is a subset of $\mathbb{R}$. Informally, measure is a way to indicate the *mass*, so to speak, of a set. Imagine a rod made up of all real numbers in $(0,1)$; denote its mass by the (length) $1$. What should the mass of the set of points \\(\lbrace0, 1/2, 1\rbrace\\) be? Intuition tells us that points are massless, so any finite collection of points must have mass of 0. But consider \\(S = \lbrace 1, \frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{4}, \frac{1}{8}, \frac{1}{16}, ...\rbrace \\) with infinite elements. Do they have mass of zero? Is $S$ any different from $(0, 1)$, as both sets have infinite elements?

If you have ever heard about the notion of countable and uncountable sets, it will be clear that the two infinite sets are a completely different animal. Mathematician Georg Cantor developed the relevant theory (shortly before going mad); you can read more <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinal_number">here</a>.

Formally, the Lebesgue measure of $A$ is the greatest lower bound (infimum) of the total length of (countably many) open intervals that cover $A$. It can be shown that $\mu(S) = 0$ by covering each and every one of its elements with an interval of length $\epsilon$. Since $\epsilon$ can be made arbitrarily small, the greatest lower bound of the total length of open intervals is zero. Grant Sanderson has a great visual representation <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyW5z-M2yzw">here</a>, as he always does.

With this definition, it is not difficult to prove some important ideas of measure. To list a few,

\\[
\mu(\mathbb{Q}) = 0
\\]

\\[
\mu(\{a_1, a_2, a_3, ...\}) = 0
\\]

\\[
\mu((a,b)) = b-a
\\]
Furthermore, we say that sets $A$ and $B$ is equal almost everywhere and write $A=B$ $\mathrm{a.e.}$ iff $A$ and $B$ differ only on a set of measure zero. For example, \\([0,1]=(0,1)\\) \\(\mathrm{a.e.}\\).


## Indicator Functions
<p>
This is a notational concept: the indicator function is \(\mathbf{1}_{A}(x)=1\) if \(x\in A\) and
\(\mathbf{1}_{A}(x)=0\) otherwise. The function \(\mathbf{1}_{A}(x)\) is the indicator function of
\(A\). Specifically, \(\mathbf{1}_{\mathbb{Q}}(x)\) is called the <em>Dirichlet function</em>. Spoiler alert:
the Dirichlet function is the most iconic function that cannot be Riemaan integrated.

## The Lebesgue Integral
Some slightly misleading thumbnails describe the Lebesgue integral as a *horizontal Riemaan sum*. There is some truth to this, and we will first observe the Lebesgue integrals of *simple functions*.

Simple functions, loosely speaking, take only a finite number of values per subset of its domain. They are of the form
\\[\psi(x) = \sum_{k} a_k  \mathbf{1}_{A_k}(x)\\]
