I made this simple pacman clone nearly three years ago, when I was still a novice python programmer.<!--more-->Recently I decided to upload this to github pages with the help of an insanely great WebAssembly front for pygame, `pygbag`. You can find the game at <a style="color:yellow;" href="https://abghim.github.io/pacman">abghim.github.io/pacman</a> (it takes around 30 seconds to load the first time you visit -- hang on in the cyan screen). The source is definitely available, but keep in mind that it is the spaghetti of spaghetti codes wrapped in an absolute beginner's struggle to make something reasonable.

With that out of the way, please enjoy!
